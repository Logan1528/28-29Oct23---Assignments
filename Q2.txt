Q2.Explain the Git Workflow, including the staging area, working directory, and repository

Ans:
	Identifying a single Git workflow is a necessary step in ensuring rapid delivery. 
Software development teams encompass contributors from various backgrounds and experiences,
 and they're likely to feel comfortable with a workflow they've used previously. Without a 
single workflow, a team's development workflow could be chaotic and slow down cycle time.
Git workflows empower teams to determine roles and responsibilities, set boundaries, and 
identify areas of improvement.

Five Popular Git workflows For Better Code:

*Centralized Workflow

*Feature Branch Workflow

*Gitflow Workflow

*Forking Workflow

*Pull Request Workflow


working directory

	Working Directory​ A working directory is a folder you create to store all your 
project's files. In contrast, a Git directory is a folder Git creates in the working 
directory you instructed it to monitor.

staging area

	The staging area is a file, generally contained in your Git directory, that stores 
information about what will go into your next commit. Its technical name in Git 
parlance is the “index”, but the phrase “staging area” works just as well.

repositary

A repository, or repo, is a centralized digital storage that developers use to make 
and manage changes to an application's source code. Developers have to store and 
share folders, text files, and other types of documents when developing software.
